# Car-lane-detection

In this project I use more advaced techniques to detect a lane on the road

Check out the <a href="https://github.com/neerajdixit/car-lane-detection/blob/master/car-lane-detection.ipynb">notebook</a> for code and explanation

## Steps

* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
* Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
* Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
* Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
* Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position
